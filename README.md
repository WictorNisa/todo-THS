Todo List Application
This is a simple and interactive Todo List application built using Vanilla JavaScript. The app allows users to manage tasks with features like adding, editing, marking as complete/incomplete, reordering, and deleting todo items. The todos are stored in localStorage to persist data even after the page is refreshed.
